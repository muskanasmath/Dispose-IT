# Dispose-IT
 Collaboratively designed and developed a web app enabling drones, CCTVs, and citizens to capture and upload garbage images. The backend utilizes Mask R-CNN for Geo-Mapped image analysis, estimating trash area and volume. Results are updated across systems, alerting authorities to take prompt action.
